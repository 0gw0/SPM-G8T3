-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/0gw0/SPM-G8T3.git
    cd SPM-G8T3
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**

    In the project root directory, run:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

    This will install all the necessary dependencies for the project.

3. **Set up environment variables**

    Add the `.env` file in the root directory

4. **Run the development server**

-   `npm run dev`: Runs the app in development mode
-   `npm run build`: Builds the app for production
